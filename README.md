# money_tree

A new Flutter project that is now a part of my final year project. This is a revamped and re-imagined version of my previous attempt at making a budgeting application also available on my github page.

## Implementation Wishes

The targeted user for this application is someone who is serious about saving money and they have tried all the other applications in the market and it does not work for them. 

## Idea
The user is able to set up a recurring income in the application that means that after every time a certain time-frame is passed that would be automatically added to their total value. Alternatively, let’s say that the user received £50 as a gift from a loved one then they are also able to add non-recurring or one-off amounts as income. The income when entered will ask for details such as the source of the income, the category that income would fit into, the amount of income, where the income has gone (account, cash etc) and a notes/picture section that the user is able to look back to. When the user is presented to the main app-screen they will see their income spread out according to the famous, 50/30/20 rule. This would be categorised in the app as essentials, discretionary purchases and savings. This will just be the pre-set ratio as they are able to change the ratio to suit them. 

## Research
From the research I have done the reason people never save a lot of money is because they have nothing to hold them accountable if they go over their spend limit and that they never set amount goals or materialistic goals for the savings. My plan for tackling this is two-fold, for them to be accountable the next month the app automatically sets a higher savings goal and my idea for setting goals comes from addicted phone games where the user wants to get their rewards for completing tasks. On the whole, this is a very robust budgeting application with sophistications such as a receipt scanner and graphs and charts to visualise data but also has its gamification element to keep the user engaged while they are also saving money.
